####DOCKER FILE FOR IMAGE OF TEI JENKINS SERVER####

# Written by Martin Holmes, December 2016. #

# We start from the latest Jenkins, which is based on
# openjdk:jdk-8, which is based ultimately on debian 
# jessie.

# As the Jenkins page says, the image should be started like
# this: 

# docker run --name teijenkins -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -v /your/home:/var/jenkins_home jenkins

# thus storing all jenkins data in /your/home, or like this:

# docker run --name teijenkins -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -v /var/jenkins_home jenkins

# My own version for the record:
# docker run --name teijenkins -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -v /home/mholmes/WorkData/tei/jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home jenkins

# IMPORTANT NOTE: If you run this container, the VERY FIRST thing you should do is to 
#                 configure security in Jenkins. Out of the box, it allows anyone 
#                 to run any job without any login. DO NOT FORGET TO DO THIS.

# We need to build rnv locally since it's no longer packaged for
# Debian. Doing this before installing other stuff because it's
# quicker for testing purposes. We need make for that. Do apt-utils
# first so that it's available when other stuff is being installed.
# libexpat-dev is required to build rnv.

# Install a bunch of packages we need. This package list has been 
# customized a little from the original 2016 builder script set,
# because we're working with Debian Jessie instead of Ubuntu.
# Many required packages are already installed upstream. 
# Various tex-related packages have been added as build failures
# revealed the need for them.

# provide a file listing all the plugins you want to install.
