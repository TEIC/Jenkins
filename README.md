# Jenkins
This repository contains configurations, build scripts and instructions for setting up and maintaining Jenkins build servers for the TEI. The original approach taken was an all-in-one shell script designed to run on a vanilla Ubuntu server instance; this worked in Ubuntu 12.04 but proved more difficult to achieve in later versions, so starting in 2016, the approach has switched to the creation of a docker container which can run the basic build jobs. As of December 2016, this is basically working; the Dockerfile is inside the docker folder. The docker container inherits ultimately from Debian Jessie, not Ubuntu.

The original shell scripts are in the ServerBuildScripts folder; the log parse rule file used in Jenkins is in LogParseRules; and copies of the job configurations used on our actual build servers are in the jobs folder. The docker instance has its jobs configured slightly differently because the container is based on the official jenkins:stable from hub.docker.com, so it has its own jobs subfolder which is used during the build process. The Utilities folder has bits and pieces that are or were needed at various points.
