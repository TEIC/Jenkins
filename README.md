# Jenkins
This repository contains configurations, build scripts and instructions for setting up and maintaining Jenkins build servers for the TEI.

It will contain setup scripts based on the one originally located in the TEI repository from 2012, and subsequently tweaked and added to, designed to build a fully functional build server for all the TEI products. Jenkins configuration files as well configs for individual jobs will be housed here.
